# Project Overview

The Country Club Membership Database is designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for managing memberships, payments, and services at a country club. By centralizing member information and event data, the system ensures smooth operations, reduces errors, and improves service quality.

Key features of the database include tracking member personal information, membership status, payment history, activity participation, event bookings, and more. This system is designed to provide benefits for both country club members (who can manage their personal details, payments, and bookings) and workers (who can oversee member information, track activities, and assist with bookings).

# Features

Member Management: Members can update personal details, view membership type, and manage their profiles.
Payment Tracking: Members can access their transaction history and update payment methods.
Event Tracking: The system records past and upcoming events, helping members track their attendance.
Booking and Reservations: Members can book and reserve amenities, events, or services.
Worker Management: Workers can access and update member information, handle bookings, and manage events.

# User Roles
## Member Role:

# Security
## Authentication and Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only access relevant parts of the system based on their role (Member or Worker).
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) may be implemented for higher privilege operations.
## Encryption
Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using AES encryption to secure sensitive member data.

# Privacy & Compliance
## Ethical Data Handling
Clear communication with members regarding the collection and usage of their data, ensuring consent is obtained before storing sensitive information.
## Legal Compliance
The database will adhere to data protection laws such as:
CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) for users in California.
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) if health-related data is stored.
PCI-DSS standards for payment processing.
## Transparency & Accountability
Regular audits will be performed to ensure proper handling and access of sensitive data.
# Ethical Considerations
## Data Bias & Fairness
The database design ensures equal access to all members and workers, minimizing bias in data storage and retrieval.
## Data Ownership
Members retain ownership of their personal data, and their consent is required for the storage and use of such information.
The system provides detailed documentation for users and administrators to understand how to interact with the platform securely and efficiently.

# Conclusion
This Country Club Membership Database is a vital tool for improving both operational efficiency and member experience. By securely managing personal and transactional data, it helps the country club provide personalized services while maintaining a high standard of privacy and security.
