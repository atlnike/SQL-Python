# CMSC408  - Homework 6 - Spring 2025

Welcome to Homework 4! Here I am going to break down the summary, purpose of this assginment, and which files we will be editing! Thank you!

# Summary 

Homework 6 is all about working with a databse using SQL, and then creating an HTML rendered by Quarto, which performs functions on this database using SQL inside of python code.

# Where are the important files

We store our QMD inside the reports folder. Report.QMD holds the python code which we generate into HTML. Inside of the Python, we hold snippets of SQL, using the functions we defined in helpers.py. These SQL pieces manipulate, filter, and extract our database.

# Database Construction
We edited the database we have connected to through our remote poetry connection, through the MY-DDL File, which is where we populate and create each table of the database we are working with today!

# Installations

We have installed poetry. Specifically for this homework, I didn't need to install anything.

# Running

We run this assignment through rendering the quarto, which interacts with the database through a remote connection. After, establishing connection, this Report.QMD file is converted to HTML, and it runs the Python code, which interacts with the database. We populated this database beforehand in My-DDL.SQL!

Thank you! That is all! Really frusturating assignment, but glad it worked out!
