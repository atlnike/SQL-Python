# SRC folder

This folder contains a scaffold *report.qmd* file.  That is, I started the homework assignment
for you.

Your task is to clean up the *report.qmd* incrementally, making a few changes at a time and reviewing
the rendered results.

When you're done, render the document one last time and commit/push your changes to github.

For homework 1:

* You'll need to upload *report.html* to Canvas, and
* You'll need to post this repo to gradescope for autograding.
