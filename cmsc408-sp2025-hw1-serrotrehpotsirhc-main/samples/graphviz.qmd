This QMD file will render a horizontal flowchart using Graphviz when compiled with Quarto. You can experiment by adjusting the nodes, edges, and labels to customize your diagram further.


# Experimenting with Horizontal Graphviz Diagrams

This is a simple example of how to include a horizontally flowing Graphviz diagram in a Quarto document.

```{dot}
digraph G {
    rankdir=LR;  // This sets the direction to Left-Right
    graph [margin=0];
    Start [shape=circle, label="Start"];
    DoSomething [shape=box, label="Do Something"];
    IsItDone [shape=diamond, label="Is it Done?"];
    End [shape=ellipse, label="End"];

    Start -> DoSomething;
    DoSomething -> IsItDone;
    IsItDone -> End [label="Yes"];
    IsItDone -> DoSomething [label="No"];
}

```


# Explanation

- **Graph Direction**: The `rankdir=LR;` attribute sets the graph direction to flow from left to right.

- **Node Shapes**: Different shapes like `circle`, `box`, `diamond`, and `ellipse` are used to represent different types of nodes.
