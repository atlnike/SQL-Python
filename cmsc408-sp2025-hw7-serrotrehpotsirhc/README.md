# CMSC408 - Fall 2024 - Homework 7

Hello!

Last week, in Homework 6, I set up connection to the remote HR database, and started to work with tables defined and popoulated in the MY-DDL.SQL file from Homework 6! We used Select statements last week, to pull the tables we wanted to from the database using SQL commands! This week, we are going to repeat the basic information of Homework 6, while implementing addition SQL problem sets using JOIN commands to incorporate the newly formed Roles and Peopleroles tables inside this newly updated MY-DDL.SQL file in Homework 7!

We are going to be writing the SQL commands to manipulate the HR database through python code inside of:

Report.QMD 

We are going to create and populate the Roles and Peopleroles tables using DDL inside of:

MY-DDL.SQL

# Final Notes

Each of these files are inside the reports folder. Our credentials are still stored in the .env file. We need SQL, Quarto, Poetry, and Pandas installed, with the SQLTools extension to work through SQL commands. We will use Quarto to render the Report.QMD file into an HTML deliverable!

Thank you!
