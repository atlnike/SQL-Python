# CMSC 408 - Spring 2025 - Deliverable 4 - Video Pitch


Hello! This is 408 Crew!

408 Crew consists of 

1. Christopher Torres
2. Kelechukwu Onyedeke
3. Lindsey Marandina

For this Deliverable and for the Semester Project, 408 Crew will be working to design a database for a Country Club!

It will be a simple database which offers Business owners to creatively generate any statistic, forecast adjustments, and create any operation upon the data to pull!

For example, a pormpt like "I want to know how well chocolate ice cream sells at the cafe on Tuesdays. Or, what would the forecasted revenue be if we did a sale at .35 % off that day?" 

Prompts like these could be parsed to our system using the User data. Our data can also be used for the user's benefit, by curtailing requests based upon their data. 

Deliverable 4 Video Pitch is a rough draft Project Proposal which introduces our Country Club semester project to Professor Leonard.

Our database proposal includes a video and report. This deliverable includes the video, report, and reflection.

THis deliverable is a simple assignment which embeds the Video Pitch through the report.qmd file, which also contains the report.

If there are any questions, please let us know!

Thanks!
