# Homework 5 - CMSC408 - Spring 2025

This will be the first homework to involve SQL! We are going to installing necessary python packages to get SQL up and running while Quarto converts our code to HTML through VSCode! This will set us up for SQL to end the semester and it will give us the tools to design our own database using SQL!

## Homework tasks

Together, we will:

1. Install the necessary python tools and libraries

2. Verify that the tools and libraries are installed.

3. Verify that you can log into the phpMyAdmin site.

4. Verify that your VSCODE can connect to the mySql server.

5. Explore queries and result sets using pandas

6. Explore Quarto as a tool for writing out tables.

7. Explore and document a new database that some provided to you.

8. Render explore.qmd to ensure that everything works.

9. Complete the report.qmd scaffold and render the report!

## Files and folders

All necessary files are stored in the *./reports* folder.
