# Welcome to Homework 2 - CMSC408 - Spring 2025

Hello All,

This is Homework 2. 

My application converts a text through Quarto such as Mermaid and Graphiz to design the ER Diagrams I designed for each of the three scenarios detailed in the HTML Report this generates.

This repo contains this ReadMe and a reports folder, which includes the Report.qmd file I will be editing for the duration of this Homework Assignment which deals with ER Diagramming. 

Read the README.md inside of the reports folder to understand the purpose of each of the other files. 

Overview of Homework 2:

ER Diagramming are Entity-Relationship diagrams which provide a visual representation of a systemâ€™s data and the relationships between data entities. ER Diagrams are essential for designing and understanding database structures before implementation.

As we learned in Homework 1,

Key Components of ER Diagramming:

1. Entities:

Represent objects or concepts (such as Customer, Event, or Grant) that have data stored about them.

2. Attributes:

Properties or characteristics of entities (e.g., customerID, name, email). Primary keys uniquely identify each entity.

3. Relationships:

Illustrate how entities are connected. They can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. Relationship labels (such as purchases, funds, or works_on) clarify the nature of the connection.

4. Cardinality:

Specifies the numerical mapping between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many), which is crucial for understanding data constraints.

This Homework 2 includes:

1. Choosing three scenarios to model ER Diagrams for.

2. Generating Diagrams in Chen's Notation using Graphiz and Crows Foot Notation through Mermaid. Each through Quarto.

3. Reflect on design choices for each scenario and come up with considerations, tradeoffs, and assumptions made about each.

4. Form Relation Sets based on each system through schema.

Learning objectives for Homework 2:

1. Better learn Relations Schema through Relation Sets assignment
2. Better reflect on design choices and the impacts of each to prepare students for the larger assignment
3. Better learn how to generate Diagrams in Graphiz and Mermaid
4. Learn how to implement Database scenarios with cardinality restrictions
