Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis


## Intro

Hello! Welcome to HW 9! This is our final Homework assignment! My message to my future self: I hope you had a great semester learning about SQL! 

In this assignment, I will be working through 11 more SQL queries! These queries will continue to help improve my SQL skills and generate a Report.HTML file which will walk through each query with code and outputs included for each! 

For this assignment, we will be workign again with the WDI database! This database will be remote. We will be making more local copies to interact with. Our queries will take place in the Report.QMD file in the Reports folder! This will be the only file we will be editing for this assignment!

## Permissions

I also updated .env with the HW8 passcode! This HW will be in preperation for our final Database assignment! My group will be making a database for a country club!

## Data

The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. 

The World Bank also conducts research and analysis to address global development challenges and improve the living conditions of people in low and middle-income countries.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a comprehensive and extensive database maintained by the World Bank, offering a wealth of statistical information on various facets of global development.

It includes data on economic indicators like GDP, inflation rates, and trade, as well as social indicators such as education, health, and poverty.

## Purpose

We will be working directly with this data to manipulate these fiugres into useful outputs! This is another practice using SQL for my job as a WDI database analyst! Again, I hope this HW assignment is as exciting to read as it was to create! 

Thank you!
