# Welcome to Homework 4

This Homework, we will be learning more about normalization, denormalization, and gain practice with BCNF, Normalization, and Relational Algebra Queries!

There are going to be 5 sections:

1. Introduction to Normalization
2. Quiz Prep Tools, Resources, and References
3. Normalization Terms and Definitions
4. Practice with Closures and Normal Forms.
5. 5 Part Problem Set 
    a. 3 BCNF Problems
    b. 1 Normalization Problem
    c. 1 Relational Algebra Query problem
6. ReadME
7. Reflection

We use Quarto to generate an HTML report from our Report.qmd file. Both of these are found in the Reports folder. We will only be editing the Report.qmd and README.md files. The Report.HTML will automatically be generated with Quarto!

Also, for the definitions, I referenced the two suggested course textbooks:

1. Ramakrishnan, J. Gehrke, Database Management Systems, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill ISBN 0072465638. 

2. Silberschatz, S. Sudarshan, H.F. Korth, Database system concepts, Sixth Edition, McGraw Hill. 

We also use Cho's Calculator for help with the BCNF work!

_Quarto.yml in the reports folder holds relevant time, identification, and email for this submission!

As always, let me know if there is any issue with this report, and I will see you next time!
